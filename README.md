C++ Programming 
This repository contains various C++ programs demonstrating fundamental and advanced concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP), templates, operator overloading, exception handling, and more.
List of Programs

1. Library Book Management
Write a C++ program to manage the details of a book in a library. Create an object of the class and call displayDetails() to display the book's information.
2. Employee Salary Calculation
Write a C++ program to create an Employee class containing the following data members: employee name, employee number, basic salary, Dearness Allowance (DA), Income Tax (IT), and net salary. The program calculates the gross salary and displays employee details.
3. Hybrid Inheritance
Write a C++ program to demonstrate hybrid inheritance by creating a class hierarchy involving Animal, Mammal, Bird, and Bat classes.
4. Function Overloading: Distance Addition
Write a C++ program to illustrate function overloading by adding distances in feet and inches or just feet.
5. Class Template: Maximum of Two Numbers
Write a C++ program to create a class template to find the maximum of two numbers. The class template should work with different data types such as int and float.
6. Function Template: Arithmetic Operations
Write a C++ program to create a function template that can perform various arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two operands. Demonstrate the use of the function template with at least two different data types.
7. Friend Functions and Exception Handling
•	i) Write a C++ program to demonstrate the use of a friend function.
•	ii) Write a C++ program to demonstrate exception handling by catching and handling division by zero errors.
8. Shopping List Management
Write a C++ program to process a shopping list for a departmental store. The list includes details such as the code number and price of each item and supports operations like adding, deleting items, and calculating the total order value.
9. Unary Operator Overloading
Write a C++ program to overload the unary operator - in two ways:
•	i) As a member function.
•	ii) As a friend function.
10. Complex Number Arithmetic
Write a C++ program to perform the addition and subtraction of two complex numbers using the binary + and - operators.

How to Run
1.	Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.	Open each .cpp file in your preferred C++ IDE or text editor.
3.	Compile and run the program using your compiler (e.g., g++).
